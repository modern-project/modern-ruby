## Using Modern ##
A detailed description is on the way. For now, please feel free to peruse our
[test cases] and the beginnings of our [manual] to get an idea of Modern and how
it works.

## Contributing ##
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome [on GitHub]. This project is intended
to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected
to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant] code of conduct.

The best way to start contributing is to look for `TODO` comments in the code;
they're sprinkled liberally wherever it didn't quite make sense to do something
yet but some ideas might be lurking that describe how it could be handled. If
not? File an issue and let's chat about it!

## License ##

## Code of Conduct ##
Everyone interacting in the Modern project’s codebases, issue trackers, chat
rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct].
