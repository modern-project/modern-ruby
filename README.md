[test cases] and the beginnings of our [manual] to get an idea of Modern and how
it works.

## Versioning ##

addendum: until the project reaches the 1.0.0 mark, the minor version number

The best way to start contributing is to look for `TODO` comments in the code;
they're sprinkled liberally wherever it didn't quite make sense to do something
yet but some ideas might be lurking that describe how it could be handled. If
not? File an issue and let's chat about it!
